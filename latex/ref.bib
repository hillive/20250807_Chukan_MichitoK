abstract = {X-Rings is a novel hand-mounted 360 degree shape display for Virtual Reality that renders objects in 3D and responds to user-applied touch and grasping force. Designed as a modular stack of motor-driven expandable rings (5.7-7.7 cm diameter), X-Rings renders radially-symmetric surfaces graspable by the user's whole hand. The device is strapped to the palm, allowing the fingers to freely make and break contact with the device. Capacitance sensors and motor current sensing provide estimates of finger touch states and gripping force. We present the results of a user study evaluating participants’ ability to associate device-rendered shapes with visually-rendered objects as well as a demo application that allows users to freely interact with a variety of objects in a virtual environment.},

abstract = {Controllers that convey tactile sensations of object size in virtual environments are crucial for user interaction. However, existing research often faces commercialization constraints due to the complexity and high number of actuators required. This study proposes a haptic device that utilizes a spiral spring structure that offers approximately three times the variable range with a single actuator. This system can quickly render the diameters of objects grasped by users and simulate continuous volume changes, such as inflating a balloon. Due to its simple structure and wide variable range, this system is expected to be suitable for various scenarios, providing users with a more immersive virtual reality experience.},

abstract = {Haptic perception of physical sizes increases the realism and immersion in Virtual Reality (VR). Prior work rendered sizes by exerting pressure on the user’s fingertips or employing tangible, shape-changing devices. These interfaces are constrained by the physical shapes they can assume, making it challenging to simulate objects growing larger or smaller than the perceived size of the interface. Motivated by literature on pseudo-haptics describing the strong influence of visuals over haptic perception, this work investigates modulating the perception of size beyond this range. We developed a fixed-sized VR controller leveraging finger-repositioning to create a visuo-haptic illusion of dynamic size-change of handheld virtual objects. Through two user studies, we found that with an accompanying size-changing visual context, users can perceive virtual object sizes up to <Formula format="inline"><TexMath><?TeX $44.2\%$?></TexMath><AltText>Math 1</AltText><File name="chi24-364-inline1" type="svg"/></Formula> smaller to <Formula format="inline"><TexMath><?TeX $160.4\%$?></TexMath><AltText>Math 2</AltText><File name="chi24-364-inline2" type="svg"/></Formula> larger than the perceived size of the device. Without the accompanying visuals, a constant size (<Formula format="inline"><TexMath><?TeX $141.4\%$?></TexMath><AltText>Math 3</AltText><File name="chi24-364-inline3" type="svg"/></Formula> of device size) was perceived.},

abstract = {In this paper, we present a transformable controller. The controller consists of multiple triangular prisms. Its three-dimensional shape can be freely changed by twisting each prism. The shape of an item in the game changes when a game player changes the shape of the controller. The shape of the controller changes immediately if the shape of the corresponding game items changes in the game world. This feature makes the player feel more sense of unity with the game character. We developed some prototype controllers and a game that could be played with the controllers. We conducted some experiments to evaluate the quality of the game experience with IEQ questionnaire. The first experimental result showed that we could not find any significant differences. However, we could find some implications to improve the controller. After the improvement, the second experimental result showed that a significant 5\% difference in two items, "immersion" and "emotional involvement".},
